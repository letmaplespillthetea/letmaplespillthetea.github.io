  Here’s the song I listened to and thought about a lot while writing this. If you care enough, maybe you can click the link and listen. I’ll be very grateful.

There are times I've wanted to stay where it felt familiar. Not because it was good for me, but because it was known. Familiar routines, doubts and limits. 

At some point, even sadness and anxiety start to feel like part of who I am. They aren't just passing emotions. They've become a part of my identity. And the thought of losing them makes me uneasy. If they disappeared, would I still know who I am? If I stop feeling this way, does that mean I've lost something in me? Healing seems scary.

There's a strange comfort in what hurts but doesn't surprise me. I know how to exist in that space and what to expect. I know who I am in it, even if that is not the version I want to stay as forever. The familiar gives a sense of control, which creates the illusion of safety. That's the trick.

But one day, out of the blue, on a quiet night, something shifted. There was no big moment. Just a calm stillness that felt different. The weight was still there, but I could finally feel the space around it. I realized how tired I was. How stuck. And deep inside, a voice rose up, firm and clear: I must go.

People often ask me why I decided to pursue game design. I usually give them a list of practical reasons: because it blends creativity with technology, because I love interactive storytelling, because it lets me use both my skills and imagination. But there's one reason I hesitate to say out loud. Every time someone asks me that question, there's one thought that echoes in my mind. Lately it's becoming clearer and clearer: If I don't pursue something creative, something artistic, I will be dead inside. I would spend the rest of my life like a zombie: walking, breathing, but not truly living. Like the poet Nguyen Trong Tao once wrote:

> *"There is a forest that died but still stays green inside me  
> There is a person alive but already like the dead."*

I must go, not because I have a destination in mind, but because I know that staying still too long makes my soul shrink. When I shrink, curiosity fades. And the part of me that wants to create begins to question if it even matters. That's when I know I have to move. For myself, and for the part of me that still wants to see, feel, and make something real.

When I was younger, I used to hear people talk about dreams and I could not stand it. I told myself I would just pick a normal job, and learn to be content. Art would stay a hobby. I thought that was maturity. I also thought I was being smart. That I wouldn't fall into the same old traps. That I wouldn't romanticize the suffering of the artist, or glorify being broke and burned out. I wanted to be realistic. But realism without purpose slowly turned into resignation.

I've been drawn to art ever since I was a child. One of my earliest memories, from the moment I became aware of the world, is of me holding a pencil and scribbling little sketches. Even then, I didn't think I was good at it. That's probably why I admired people who were. I looked at their work and thought, “I could never do that.”

So I told myself it would be better to step away from art. To choose a more practical path, something that actually suited me. I admit I'm not patient enough for art. I get frustrated easily. And honestly, I didn't believe I could ever be good enough to make a living from it anyway.

But the more I immerse myself in drawing, or even just visiting galleries and appreciating other people's work, the more something stirs in me. It's quiet, but deep. Still, I keep thinking it would be immature to throw everything away and chase a path I'm not even good at. I try to hide that feeling, to push it down, but it doesn't work anymore.

It feels so amazing to create something that is bigger than myself. Bigger than my sorrow, self-doubt and even my happiness. When I make something, no matter how clumsy it is, I step outside the perpetual loop of overthinking. I stop being just someone who feels too much and starts becoming someone who shapes those feelings into something, well, I dare say, beautiful.

Creating is a trade. You give your time, attention and your rawest thoughts. You risk being seen, and even misunderstood. In return, if you’re lucky, or just by simply being honest, you get meaning. You get to feel like you’ve put a piece of yourself out into the world that wasn’t there before.

Art gives my feelings somewhere to go. Not through my own work, but through what others have made. Their songs, drawings, and stories say the things I didn’t know how to say. It’s strange and magical how hearing someone express their loneliness can make you feel less alone. I've always admired these people, watching them from afar. I never thought I could do the same. But sometimes, when I look at what I've made, I still think: this came from me, but it also speaks to something beyond me.

That feeling of connecting with something larger through creation is why I can't ignore it anymore.

That's why I must go.

It's not like I want to prove anything, or because I believe I'll become a great artist. It's just that something inside me refuses to stay silent any longer. 

So this time I'll go. I'm scared. I'm slow. I don't know what comes next. But staying behind is no longer an option.

This is the story of little me holding onto a big dream.
